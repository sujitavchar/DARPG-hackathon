# DARPG-hackathon
This is a hackathon project prototype.  It converts audio file into hindi ,  english and hinglish text.


Our project aims to enhance the performance of an open-source speech-to-text transcription tool, specifically tailored for converting citizen feedback calls in Hindi, English, and Hinglish into accurate text. Focused on refining an existing solution rather than creating a new one, our goal is to benchmark the tool's current performance and implement optimizations that lead to significant improvements in transcription accuracy. By evaluating the tool's efficiency, we identify areas for enhancement and introduce modifications to achieve measurable advancements. Our strategy involves collaborative efforts to fine-tune the tool's language processing capabilities, ensuring it aligns seamlessly with the linguistic nuances of Hindi, English, and Hinglish. This hackathon project not only addresses the technical challenges of optimizing the transcription tool but also emphasizes its practical application in real-world scenarios, particularly in handling citizen grievances. The refined tool will contribute to the efficient conversion of feedback calls into accurate text, facilitating better understanding and analysis of citizen concerns. Key Focus Areas: 1. Benchmarking current tool performance. 2. Identification of optimization opportunities. 3. Implementation of enhancements for improved accuracy. 4. Evaluation of language-specific nuances for Hindi, English, and Hinglish. 5. Practical application in handling citizen grievances. Expected Impact: - Measurable improvements in transcription accuracy. - Enhanced usability in processing citizen feedback calls. - Increased effectiveness in understanding and addressing citizen concerns. By participating in this hackathon, we aim to contribute to the advancement of speech-to-text technology, emphasizing its role in fostering efficient communication between citizens and authorities.
